# 🎮 Retro Console & Emulator Programming – Howest DAE (2024)

Hey there, fellow DAE student, curious visitor, or retro enthusiast 👋  
Welcome to our **Retro Console & Emulator Programming** repository — a showcase of what we built during the **third semester (2024)** at **Digital Arts & Entertainment**, **Howest University**, **Kortrijk, Belgium**.

## 🗂️ About this repository

This repo contains our **NES homebrew project**, fully written in **6502 Assembly**.  
The result is an interactive “presentation” app — **NESlides** — where the player can navigate between slides and shoot every tile on screen, completely erasing the slide if they wish.

It’s a playful experiment that merges **low-level programming**, **hardware constraints**, and a touch of chaos.

## 🎯 Learning Goals (LR09)

> *The student Bachelor Digital Arts & Entertainment works in a problem-solving way, using context-specific programming skills and technical knowledge of underlying game technology, taking the imposed directives and technical limitations into account.*

- Understands the architecture and operation of vintage 8-bit hardware.  
- Writes low-level code in Assembly for constrained environments.  
- Applies debugging and optimization strategies at machine level.  
- Develops tools and workflows for efficient data generation.  
- Collaborates effectively in a technical group project.

## 🧩 Project Description – NESlides

**NESlides** is a custom-built interactive slideshow for the **Nintendo Entertainment System**.  
- Move between slides using a character.  
- Destroy (shoot) every tile — even the text.  
- Each slide is stored as tilemap data on the cartridge.  
- The presentation is both *functional* and *destructible*.

To simplify content creation, we developed **[NESlidesEditor](https://github.com/JohnyTheCarrot/NESlidesEditor)** — a C++ desktop tool that allows easy slide design and NES ROM export.

## 🚀 Release

📦 **retro_console_and_emulator_programming-neslides-1.0.0-nes.zip**  
Contains the final NES ROM release of *NESlides*.  
Tested with **FCEUX** and **Mesen** emulators.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This project offered us a deep dive into **hardware-level programming** and **retro system architecture**, providing hands-on experience with memory management, CPU cycles, and the quirks of the **6502 processor**.  
It’s one of those projects that teaches you to *respect every byte*.
